        body: 'Ask almost any personal trainer and they’ll tell you that regardless of your training goals, healthy eating is the backbone. Food is what fuels your body to reach your goals, and without proper nutrition through quality foods, you’re likely to stall. Maintain a balanced diet consisting of fruits, vegetables, complex carbohydrates, complete proteins, and healthy fats like fish oils and flaxseeds.',

        title:'Eat more clean food.',
        body: 'Eating only three daily meals? Not a great idea. “Half the people I deal with aren’t losing weight because they don’t eat enough,” says veteran personal trainer Mike Duffy. Duffy advises his clients “to eat five times a day, about every three hours, to stimulate their metabolism” including two mini-meals between three basic meals. With activity levels decreasing throughout the day, he advises to “eat less as the day goes on.”',

        body: 'You’ll be eating more often, so paying attention to portions is extremely important. “Make sure chicken breasts, (and) meats, are no larger than your palm, and that pastas are no larger than your fists,” says Jay Cardiello, a personal trainer to countless celebrities and professional athletes. He also suggests using “smaller bowls, plates, and cups” because studies show people “serve themselves 20-40% more food when they’re using larger plates.”',

        body: 'Talk to any personal trainer and they’ll tell you there are certain muscle-building basics. First, increase your caloric and complete protein intake, so your body has enough building blocks to get bigger. Then, when you enter the gym, focus on your form. Perform compound movements and train with weights on average around four times a week. Never underestimate the importance of rest.',

        body: 'Wondering how to get the most out of lifting weights? “Use a weight that will have you failing on the set between the 30- and 40-second mark,” Duffy says. Time under tension causes muscle to grow. “If you’re failing at 20 seconds, you know that weight was too heavy.”',

        body: 'If getting huge is your goal, then throttle back on your cardio workouts, says LaCerte—chances are, you’ll be burning far too many calories. So what should you do if you still want to get in some cardio? LaCerte says “a light jog a few days per week for 20 minutes is adequate.” If you’re aiming to burn fat, of course, then focus on getting enough protein every day (usually one gram of protein per pound of ideal body weight), while still keeping your overall caloric intake low.',

        body: 'Some trainers and lifters feel supplements can play a key role in boosting muscle gains. If you subscribe to that theory, then chances are, you’re already taking protein supplements—but what else? Creatine, for one, “seems to be about the most effective strength- and size-building supplement,” Trink says. To boost your performance, you may also want to try peppermint. Cardiello explains that the scent “alters the perception of how hard you’re working out,” making it seem “less strenuous, slower-paced, and easier to complete.”',

        body: 'When it comes to training for endurance, you’ll need to be hydrated and be sure you’re eating properly because, by its very nature, this form of training is very demanding on your body. You should be doing a good mix of cardio and weight training. And, to increase your aerobic capacity, you should incorporate high-intensity interval training, or HIIT.

        body: 'If you already own a heart rate monitor or fitness tracker, then this is a good time to start using it. If not, you may want to either go out and buy one, or learn how to do it yourself. “Don’t just exercise for a set amount of time and call it quits,” Duffy says. “You need to bring the intensity with it, and a fitness tracker can help you get a sense of exactly how hard your heart is working.”',

        title:'Exhaust for endurance.',
        body: 'To further your endurance training, you need to put in total effort. “You’re going for muscle exhaustion, so remember to fully exhaust the muscles,” Boyce says. How can you do that? Boyce suggests that you “get good at the bodyweight staples—pullups, chinups, pushups, inverted rows, (and) squats. If you can master these movements for high reps, your muscles will get well-conditioned.”',

        title:'Consider reducing rest time.',
        body: 'It’s always tempting to take a break when training, but LaCerte advises that you should “stick with rest times of 30 to 45 seconds between sets, because this will help increase your overall endurance. If you are strength training, lift moderate to heavy weight and keep your rep range between 8–15 reps. If you’re running, mix low-intensity, steady-state cardio with sprinting.”',

        body: 'Fatigue may be your biggest enemy when endurance training, but there are some ways to combat it. First, drink beet juice, which is packed with healthy nitrates that can improve your cardiovascular functioning. “Beets can actually increase stamina by up to 16%, and it helps your muscles produce more energy, more efficiently, making exercise less exhausting,” Boyce says. Another way to boost your performance is by carefully selecting your music. “When people listen to favorable music their blood vessels expanded 26%,” according to a study, Boyce says.',

When you’re in the gym, don’t get distracted. Stay focused on the task at hand. When you leave the gym, make sure you get proper rest and keep track of your progress.

        body: 'Motivation is key. Some good ways to stay motivated while you’re working out: Count down, not up, when performing reps.

        body: 'When strength training, you’ll be putting your body through very strenuous activity, so it’s important to maintain proper form. By maintaining proper form, “you’re guaranteed to activate the muscle groups that you are looking to train and, most important, you’ll stay healthy and injury-free,” Trink says. “The guy who can stay healthiest can train the most, and, in the long run, make the most progress.”',

Once that happens, you may notice diminishing strength gain results. To avoid this possibility, “switch up how heavy you’re lifting, your tempo of an exercise, your rep/set count, or what time of the day you’re lifting,” he says.',

        body: 'Forget calorie counting, and start thinking of food as fuel for your body. Getting six-pack abs is usually a function of fat loss, not a lack of muscle definition—and burning fat all boils down to a simple equation: Calories in versus calories burned. That means going beyond calories and studying your macronutrient intake—fats, protein, and carbs—to understand how much you consume relative to how much you burn during a workout.',

It’s possible you’re gaining muscle and shedding body fat—and that means your net weight change will seem “stuck,” even though you’re making progress. “Take pictures on a weekly basis—front, back, (and) side pictures all from the same angle, same lighting, same clothing.” That way, you’ll see change over time, even though it may not look like it day to day.',

Cardiello suggests you drink “ice cold water first thing in the morning” adding “you’ll naturally boost your metabolism by up to 24% for 90 minutes.” LaCerte recommends you “drink at least one gallon of water per day.”',

That’s because it takes up to 20 minutes for your brain to register that you’re full, says nutritionist Wesley Delbridge, of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “Before having another helping, wait 10 to 20 minutes and drink a glass of water,” he says. “If you’re still hungry after that, then have a smaller second serving.” Chances are, though, you’ll realize you don’t actually want more.',

        body: 'It’s as simple as this: Grasping a pullup bar and holding on. “Hanging may seem boring at first, but it’s much tougher than people realize,” Holland explains. “It helps in decompressing the joints and improves grip strength when translating to other exercises that require it.”',

        body: 'Doing a strict split routine is all well and good for hypertrophy, if you’ve got the time and the inclination. But even bodybuilders—the smart ones, anyway—will tell you that at least once a week you should make sure your muscles can work together, too, not just in isolation. Movements like chops, bear crawls, and medicine-ball drills aid in muscular synergy as well as mobility, and both are essential for muscle recruitment and range of motion.',

        body: 'You’ve heard it before but it bears repeating (in perhaps a slightly different way): Muscles aren’t built in the gym; they’re built in your bed. Taking a rest-and-recovery day is not lazy—it’s essential for rebuilding after all those micro-tears you put into your muscles during an intense workout. Sometimes, that can mean an active recovery or cross-training day where you take it easy, and other times, it can mean steering clear of the gym entirely. And that’s more than OK.',

Changing up your routine can not only inspire you to try new exercises or training methods, but also prevent your body from adapting to the same old stimulus.

        body: 'You’ve probably heard people talk about squatting every day. That’s probably a little extreme for the average athlete—your body doesn’t need that much stimulus to get stronger—but it does get at a valuable point: Squatting more often can help you develop more strength. Lots of lifters avoid the squat, but squatting two or three times a week—and with some variation, like front squats or safety-bar squats—will definitely inspire growth and boost your testosterone levels Opens a New Window. .',

        title:'Stop overloading your assistance exercises.',
        body: 'Accessory exercises should assist the development of your big lifts. That’s a big reason why they exist in the first place, so you should let them do just that. If you’re loading up for a five-rep max of your rear-leg elevated split squat or cranking out a 200-pound face pull, you’re probably losing the form—and, therefore, wasting your time. Instead, focus on moving in a full range of motion, perfecting your tempo, and hitting the muscles the exercise is intended to work. They may not be big barbell movements, but they do help you build strength and progress when it comes to your big lifts.',

        title:'Understand your body’s mechanical strengths and weaknesses.',
        body: 'Each big lift has countless variations, and any of those variations can be a better alternative if traditional big lifts just don’t seem to be your thing. It takes a humble outlook to admit that a certain lift just isn’t for you, but you’ll reap serious benefits if you do. Fitness routines aren’t one-size-fits-all, and neither are individual lifts. For example, a lifter with long legs, a short torso, and poor hip mobility probably won’t find it easy to get into a perfect barbell deadlift setup, and he’ll always be at greater risk for injury than if he were to try an alternative like the trap bar deadlift (where he can keep his torso more vertical) and adjust his positioning according to his body type.',
