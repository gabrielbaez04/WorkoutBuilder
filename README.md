# WorkoutBuilder
Personal project using MERN stack. 
The idea is to build a workout and go through it

In order to run the project, do the following steps:
- clone or download the project.
- If not installed, install Node.js.
- In the console, navigate to the project folder.
- Execute "npm install" to install all project dependencies.
- Execute "npm run development" to run the app.

### Technologies:
- Material UI.
- User CRUD and auth in a MERN application
- Handling HTTP requests with an Express server
- Using a Mongoose schema for a user model
- APIs for user CRUD and auth
- Auth with JWT for protected routes
- Running backend code and checking APIs.
- Using Service Workers with workbox to avoid re calling the exercise API and using it from cache.
- Using Redux to manage the state of the app.
